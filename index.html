<h1>Type families to break code</h1>

<h2>Context</h2>

<p>Lately I'm working on a project of mine <em>mootzoo</em>. It's a REST server on a sqlite DB and it happens the protocol is growing. </p>

<p>I splitted the protocol in half. Put requests and Get requests. Put requests are easier as they return (), letting aside the failures which are not in the type.</p>

<p>Easy like</p>

<pre><code>data Put
    = Boot Mail String  
    | Invite Login Mail String
    | Logout Login String
    | Reminds Mail String
    | Migrate Login Mail String
    | New Login Attach String
    | Retract Login MessageId
    | Leave Login Dispose MessageId
    | Vote Login MessageId Bool
</code></pre>
